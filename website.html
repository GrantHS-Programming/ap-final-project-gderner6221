    <p>This is a really simple one.<br>
        <br>
        PRESS THE SPRINT BUTTON.<br>
        <br>
        I really can't stress this enough.<br>
        The ONLY thing that is even remotely a negative when it comes to sprinting,<br>
        is that it takes like a fraction of a second longer to ADS your weapon.<br>
        And the reality is that if you're not sprinting at an enemy to shotgun ape them,<br>
        or maybe going for a super fast peek with an SMG,<br>
        you're not going to be sprinting at them and then ADSing,<br>
        you're going to be slide peeking. This will be covered more later.<br>
        But anyways, sprinting just makes you infinitely faster than botwalking around everywhere.<br>
        Destiny 2 is a fast game, and you need to get places fast if you want to keep up. <br>
